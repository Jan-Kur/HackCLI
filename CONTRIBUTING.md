# Contributing Guide
Welcome! If you are seeing this there is probably a tear of joy in my eye, cause that means someone is interested in my project ðŸ¥²

Here are some tips and guidelines to help us all work together.

## Reporting a bug
Only create an issue if there doesn't already exist a similar one in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jan-Kur/HackCLI/issues).
Make sure to have the latest available version of HackCLI before making an issue. In your issue include the following: 
1. Clear description of what happened
2. Steps to reproduce the bug
3. Your operating system
4. Any error messages or screenshots

### Feature requests
Only create an issue if there doesn't already exist a similar one in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jan-Kur/HackCLI/issues). If there is already one, you can comment on it. I will prioritize feature requests with more attention.

Try to make your idea clear. You can support it with screenshots, examples etc.

### Code contributions
It's best to first create an issue about the changes you are planning. This is to avoid disappointment, for all the work you might have done, that might not get merged or needs to be refactored. I will try to review your proposition and make sure you spend your time right.

Here are the next steps: 
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch
2. When committing, try your best to have [well formed commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) (I will have to start using this myself, don't use me as an example, I'm a bad programmer)
3. After you are done, push the commits to your fork and submit a pull request. The pull request title should follow the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
